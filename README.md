# Machinations v4.05 (Archived Educational Build)

An archived build of **Machinations v4.05** by Joris Dormans (2009–2013), with an additional auto-scaling wrapper for modern displays.

This repository is based on the preserved and resized builds from [DleanJeans/Machinations](https://github.com/DleanJeans/Machinations),  
with an additional auto-scaling wrapper for modern displays.

This repository exists to preserve access to the legacy Flash-based desktop version for educational and offline use.

---

## Why

The modern web-based version at https://machinations.io requires a stable internet connection.

For users with unreliable or limited connectivity, this legacy build allows:

- Fully offline usage  
- Local experimentation  
- Educational reference  

This repo provides the archived SWF along with optional auto-scaling improvements for modern screen resolutions.
