<summary><strong>💡 WHY</strong></summary>

The modern web-based version at https://machinations.io requires a stable internet connection.

For users with unreliable or limited connectivity, this legacy build allows:

- Fully offline usage.  
- Local experimentation.  
- Educational reference.  

This repository includes the archived SWF, resized variants, and an auto-scaling build for modern screen resolutions.
