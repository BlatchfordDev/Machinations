# Machinations v4.05 (Archived Educational Build)

An archived build of **Machinations v4.05** by Joris Dormans (2009–2013), with an additional auto-scaling wrapper for modern displays.

This repository is based on the preserved and resized builds from  
[DleanJeans/Machinations](https://github.com/DleanJeans/Machinations).

This repository exists to preserve access to the legacy Flash-based desktop version for educational and offline use.

<summary><strong>WHY</strong></summary>

The modern web-based version at https://machinations.io requires a stable internet connection.

For users with unreliable or limited connectivity, this legacy build allows:

- Fully offline usage.  
- Local experimentation.  
- Educational reference.  

This repo provides the archived SWF along with optional auto-scaling improvements for modern screen resolutions.
